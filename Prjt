% Abstract
\newpage
\begin{abstract}
In today's fast-paced world, effective time and task management has become increasingly difficult. People are often overwhelmed by multiple responsibilities, deadlines, and an ever-growing list of things to do. Traditional task management tools and planners offer basic scheduling support but require constant manual effort and provide limited flexibility to adapt to real-time changes in a user's day.

This project presents the development of an AI-Based Task Scheduler — a smart, AI-powered application designed to automate and optimize daily task planning. The application allows users to input tasks with details such as priority, estimated time, and deadlines. The built-in AI intelligently generates a personalized and dynamic schedule, automatically adjusting to missed or delayed tasks and prioritizing activities based on urgency and user productivity patterns.

The project is developed using the Scrum methodology, allowing continuous improvements through regular feedback and sprint planning. The AI-Based Task Scheduler aims to help users save time, reduce mental load, and boost daily productivity—making it an ideal solution for students, professionals, and anyone seeking smarter day-to-day organization.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{General Background}
In the modern era of digital transformation and increasing workload pressures, individuals across various professions and academic fields struggle with effective time management. Traditional planning methods, such as paper-based planners and basic digital calendars, lack the intelligence to adapt to changing priorities and unexpected disruptions in daily schedules.

The proliferation of smartphones and cloud computing has created opportunities for more sophisticated task management solutions. However, most existing applications require significant manual intervention and do not leverage artificial intelligence to optimize scheduling decisions. This gap in the market presents an opportunity for developing an intelligent task scheduling system that can learn from user behavior and automatically optimize daily plans.

The concept of AI-driven personal productivity tools has gained traction in recent years, with research showing that automated scheduling can improve task completion rates by up to 40\% and reduce decision fatigue among users. This project aims to contribute to this growing field by developing a comprehensive AI-based task scheduler that combines machine learning algorithms with intuitive user interface design.

\section{Objective}
The primary objectives of this project are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop an intelligent task scheduling application that automates daily planning
    \item To implement AI algorithms that learn from user behavior and optimize task arrangements
    \item To create a user-friendly interface that supports multiple input methods including voice commands
    \item To integrate with existing productivity tools such as Google Calendar
    \item To provide real-time notifications and automatic rescheduling capabilities
    \item To track user productivity patterns and provide actionable insights
    \item To ensure data security and privacy through robust authentication mechanisms
    \item To support offline functionality with seamless synchronization
\end{itemize}

% Chapter 2: LITERATURE SURVEY
\newpage
\chapter{LITERATURE SURVEY}

\section{Existing Task Management Systems}
Current task management applications in the market can be broadly categorized into several types:

\subsection{Traditional Task Managers}
Applications like Todoist, Any.do, and Microsoft To-Do provide basic task creation, categorization, and reminder functionality. These systems rely heavily on manual input and organization by users, with limited automation capabilities.

\subsection{Calendar-Based Systems}
Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, and Apple Calendar focus on time-based scheduling but lack intelligent task prioritization and automatic optimization features.

\subsection{Project Management Tools}
Comprehensive platforms like Asana, Trello, and Monday.com offer advanced project tracking but are primarily designed for team collaboration rather than personal productivity optimization.

\section{AI-Powered Scheduling Research}
Recent academic research has explored various approaches to intelligent scheduling:

\subsection{Machine Learning Approaches}
Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms in optimizing personal schedules based on historical data and user preferences.

\subsection{Natural Language Processing}
Research in NLP has enabled more intuitive task input methods, allowing users to create tasks using natural language commands and voice input.

\subsection{Behavioral Analytics}
Academic work has shown that analyzing user productivity patterns can significantly improve scheduling recommendations and task completion rates.
